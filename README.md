SPARK is a general purpose game engine written in C++.

It is designed to be used during my 3 yers of studies at Ynov Bordeaux.

## Features
The engine is currently capable of rendering a simple 2D scene and can be used to create simple games like pong.

This engine will evolve during the next years. The following features are planned:
- 2D and 3D rendering (using Vulkan)
- Physics simulation
- Audio
- Editor
